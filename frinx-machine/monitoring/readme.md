- FRINX Machine logs
- Node monitoring
- Swarm monitoring
- SSL monitoring
- UniConfig-controller monitoring
- Workflows monitoring

### Device Monitoring

This dashboard displays data on a specific installed device/node.

### FRINX Machine Logs

This dashboard monitors all services running in FRINX Machine.
