## Demo Config Manager UI

Using the Demo Config Manager:

1) On the FRINX Machine main page, select **Explore & configure devices**.
2) Make sure that the device you want to configure is installed. If not, select **Install** first.
3) For this demo, we use the **IOS01** device. Locate the device in the list and select the corresponding gear icon on the right. (If you see a message saying **Transaction expired**, select **Refresh**).

![FRINX Machine dashboard](install_device.png)

4) For the **Loopback0** interface, change the **enabled** status to *false*.
5) Select **Save** to save your changes.
6) To review your changes, select **Calculate diff**.
7) To view the set of commands used for the change, select **Dry run**.
8) To apply changes to the device, select **Commit to network**. You can also see the changes in the Operational data store.

To revert changes made to the device configuration:

9) Select **Transactions**.
10) Select the **Revert** icon for your transaction.
11) Select **Revert changes**.

## Demo workflow UI basics

Workflow Builder is a graphical interface for Workflow Manager and is used to create, modify and manage workflows.

Workflows are groups of tasks and/or sub-workflows that can be used, for example, to install or delete devices, create loopback interfaces on devices, send messages and much more. You can create your own workflows or edit existing ones by adding or removing tasks or sub-workflows.

Every task and sub-workflow placed in a workflow has a unique reference alias, and no two workflows can share a name and version.

### Creating a new workflow

Now we will take a look at how to create a new workflow. The new workflow will be created from template workflow called **http_example_01 / 1** which can be found under explore workflows. If you dont wish to create workflow you can just execute this workflow in explore workflows.

1) The easiest way to create a new workflow is to click on **Create** button in the main page of FRINX Machine.

![FRINX Machine dashboard](WorkFlow_Manager.png)

2) In the **Name** type the name of your workflow (please keep in mind that name of the workflow cannot be later changed). **Description** stands for additional info of the workflow - you can leave it blank. Once the workflow is created **Label** can help you find your workflow in **Explore workflows** faster but you can leave it blank as well. After inserting all data click on **Save changes**.

![FRINX Machine dashboard](create_new_workflov.png)

After saving changes you will be redirected to canvas. Here we will add tasks and subworkflow in our workflow.

![FRINX Machine dashboard](workflow_map.png)

3) Click + on the **http** and **labmda** under **System tasks** and **Post_to_Slack** under **Workflows**. All tasks and subworkflows are added on same place in the canvas so you need to move them to actually see them. For connecting all parts of the workflow hower over OUT/IN where + sign will appear. Connect all parts in this way: START - http - lamda - Post_to_Slack - END. As you can see each task and workflow has its own set of characters after its name - these are reference aliases and work as unique identifier.

![FRINX Machine dashboard](workflow_map_edited.png)

Above every task/workflow you can see 2 squares:

**Update:**

![FRINX Machine dashboard](update.png)

**Remove/Expand:**

![FRINX Machine dashboard](remove_expand.png)

4) **http - adjustment**. This task provides multiple methods for working with data from web pages. Click on update above http task. On the right side you can see General Settings and Input Parameters. Leave **General Setting** the way they are and click on **Input Parameters**. Insert:
```https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/${workflow.input.selector}```
in the **URI** and leave other columns unchanged. This set of data will get data from JSON database based on selectors input. Now click on **Save Changes** under **Headers**.

![FRINX Machine dashboard](input_parameters.png)

5) **lambda - adjustment**. Click on **Input parameters** and in the **Lambda value** insert:
```${NAME_OF_HTTP_TASK.output.body}```
In our example the name is **http_1cc1**. In the **Script expression** copy-paste: `return JSON.parse($.lambdaValue)`. Lambda takes data from previous http task and returns parsed data (message text) from JSON. Click on **Save Changes**.

![FRINX Machine dashboard](lambda_task.png)

6) **Post_to_Slack - adjustment**. Click on **Input parameters** and in the **slack_webhook_id** insert T03UXD8N58B/B03VCP8U99P/jermqzN9AkhNgXYIZkP0qLI0. In the **message_text** insert:
```${NAME_OF_LAMBDA_TASK.output.result.title}```
**Post_to_Slack** is a workflow that can be used standalone or as a part of other workflows. This workflow works as as sender of messages to specific destination in Slack. Click on **Save Changes**.

![FRINX Machine dashboard](post_to_slack_task.png)

> **Info**: If you don´t see selector column just click on **Close** under the selector column, click on **Definitions** on the top left, insert the name of your workflow in the **Search by keyword**. and press run workflow under **Actions**.

7) Now the workflow is ready to be executed. Insert a number between 1 - 200  in the **selector** and press **Execute**. Click on **Continue to detail**.

![FRINX Machine dashboard](execute_workflow.png)

8) Now you can see that workflow was executed and every task was completed successfully.

![FRINX Machine dashboard](details_of_workflow.png)

The output (demo Latin JSON) of the workflow in the Slack:

![FRINX Machine dashboard](slack_creenshot.png)

You can visit Slack directly via https://join.slack.com/t/frinx-community/shared_invite/zt-1esnmbq4l-ui9xLCS4zKGHUXZxz~PdrQ to see your own message. We recommend to use the browser version.

## How to create a new custom workflow

Now we can create a new workflow from scratch:

1) Select **Create** on the main page of FRINX Machine.

![FRINX Machine dashboard](WorkFlow_Manager.png)

2) Enter details for the new workflow. Under **Name**, enter a name for your workflow (note that this name cannot be changed later). The **Description** is for additional information about the workflow and can be left empty. **Label** can help you to find your workflow later under **Explore workflows**, but can also be left empty. Select **Save changes** when ready.

![FRINX Machine dashboard](new_wf_name.png)

3) Under **System tasks**, click the **+** sign for the **lambda**, **decision** and **terminate** tasks. Under **Workflows**, click the **+** sign for **Device_identification**. Tasks and sub-workflows are added on top of each other on the canvas and can be dragged around. To connect all parts of the workflow, hover over **IN** and **OUT** where the **+** sign appears.
Connect the parts as follows: **START** - **lambda** - **decision** - **(other)** to **Device_identification** and **default** to **terminate**. Each task and workflow has a reference alias after its name, which works as unique a identifier.

![FRINX Machine dashboard](custom_wf_001.PNG)

Above every task or workflow there are two icons:

**Update:**

![FRINX Machine dashboard](update.png)

**Remove/Expand:**

![FRINX Machine dashboard](remove_expand.png)

4) **lambda** task: Makes a decision on which status to choose based on the embedded port. In this example we will only consider ports 10000–10004, and others are ignored. The lambda task lets you enter a small code (lambda - function without name) into the workflow builder.

In this case, if the specified port is both greater than or equal to 10000 and less than 10005, the status chosen is *keep working*. Otherwise, the status is *end*. This status is the output of the lambda and the input for the next task or sub-workflow.

> Sub-workflows are similar to classic workflows, but inside of another workflow. The workflow that we are creating can also be used as a building block for another workflow, becoming a sub-workflow itself. In this manner, we can layer and reuse previously created workflows.

In the **Input parameters** tab and the **Lambda value** field, enter: `${workflow.input.port}`. This indicates that the task should work with what was entered in the **port** field in the input of this workflow. (We will cover this later, in section 7.)

In the **Script expression** field, enter a small function which we described above.
```
if ($.lambdaValue >= 10000 && $.lambdaValue < 10005) { 
  return {value: 'other'}
} else { 
  return {value: false}
}
```

![FRINX Machine dashboard](lambda_1_body.PNG)

5) **decision** task: Makes a different kind of decision from the lambda task discussed above. This task works like a switch on a track, sending the train one way or another. The data needed to make a decision is supplied by the lambda task.

In the **Input parameters** tab, delete the default parameter **foo**. For the **param** parameter, enter `${lambda_IkSu.output.result.value}`. (Note that *IkSu* is an automatically generated reference alias that you must edit to match the one generated for you.) What `${lambda_IkSu.output.result.value}` means is to take the value from *lambda_xyzq* which is in the output, find the result in the output and the value in it.

If the input value for **decision** is **other**, it directs the flow towards **device_identification**. If the input value is false, it directs the flow towards **terminate**. This corresponds to the way we connected the cells in the workflow builder.

![FRINX Machine dashboard](decision_1_body.PNG)

6) **terminated** task:

In the **Input parameters** tab, enter *COMPLETED* (or *FAILED*, at your discretion) in the **Termination status** field. You can enter whatever message you want in the **Expected workflow output** field (for example, *Device not supported.*)

![FRINX Machine dashboard](terminated_1_body.PNG)

7) **Device_identification** task:

In the **Input parameters** tab under **management_ip**, enter *sample-topology*. This is the name of the topology in this installation, whereas in production you would use a real name. For **port**, enter `${workflow.input.port}`. If you enter a port number manually, the workflow will not ask for one when started (the same goes for **management_ip** and other fields). However, we want the user to be able to select a port they are interested in, as we did with the **lambda** task in section 4.

**username** and **password**: For this demo, we assume that the following login credentials are used on all devices: `username: frinx` and `password: frinx`

As above, if we enter the username and password directly, the workflow will not ask for credentials at startup.

When working with devices using different login credentials, you need to be able to change or enter them at startup. This can be achieved in the same way as with the **port** parameter:

username: `${workflow.input.username}`

password: `${workflow.input.password}`

Like we mentioned above, in this demo workflow we will assume that login credentials are the same everywhere.

![FRINX Machine dashboard](device_identification_1_body.PNG)

8) Now we can add more tasks. In the left column under **System tasks**, we can add another **lambda**. In the **Workflows** section, you can find **Read_journal_cli_device**. Let us place them next to each other after **Device_identification** and concatenate them:

![FRINX Machine dashboard](new_lambda_and_read_journal.PNG)

9) Second **lambda**: Enter `${Device_identificationRef_f7I6.output}` as the lambda value, meaning "take the output from the previous **Device_identification** task and use that".

Enter the following into the body:
```
if ($.lambdaValue.sw == 'saos') { 
  var data = $.lambdaValue.sw.toUpperCase()+$.lambdaValue.sw_version+'_1'
  return data
} else { 
  return { value: false }
}
```

A translation of what is happening here: "If the identified device is of the type *saos*, then extract the name from the output message of the previous task, change the letters to uppercase, extract the version from the output message of the previous task, glue them together and add `_1` (because that is how devices are named in this demo topology".

![FRINX Machine dashboard](lambda_2_body.PNG)

10) **Read_journal_cli_device**: In the **Input parameters** tab under **device_id**, enter `${lambda_ZW66.output.result}`.

![FRINX Machine dashboard](read_journal_body.PNG)

11) The output from **Read_journal_cli_device** is concatenated with *END*, as is the output from **terminated**. Thus we have closed our custom workflow.

![FRINX Machine dashboard](custom_task_final.PNG)
![FRINX Machine dashboard](custom_task_final_all.PNG)

12) Save and run your workflow.

![FRINX Machine dashboard](save_and_run.png)
![FRINX Machine dashboard](save_and_run_2.png)

Next steps:

Finding your new workflow and running it with multiple different inputs such as 10 000, 10 002, 10 012, etc.

![FRINX Machine dashboard](find_demo_workflow.png)

For different ports, you can see different devices with other run commands in memory.

![FRINX Machine dashboard](output_journal_commands.png)

## Demo: Building a workflow which sends a message to Slack

Now let’s look how to build a workflow. The workflow we’re about build will make a http request, parse desired part of the http response, and post the result in a slack workspace.

1) Click on **“Create workflow”** section in the main page of FRINX Machine.

![FRINX Machine dashboard](create_workflow.png)

2) In the **Name** type the name of your workflow (please keep in mind that name
of the workflow cannot be later changed and must be unique.). **Description**
stands for additional info of the workflow - you can leave it blank. Once the
workflow is created **Label** can help organizing workflows in **Explore workflows**,
but you can leave it blank as well. After inserting all data click on **Save changes**.

![FRINX Machine dashboard](create_new_workflow.png)

**“Restartable”** – when checked, in case the workflow fails, in the FRINX UI there
will be an option to restart the workflow with same inputs without starting it all
over and without creating a new workflow ID. In this case you can leave it
checked.

After saving the changes you will be redirected to canvas. Here we will add tasks
and sub workflows in our workflow.

![FRINX Machine dashboard](canvas.png)

3) Click **“+”** on the **http** and **labmda** under **System tasks** and **Post_to_Slack**
under **Workflows**. All tasks and subworkflows should be arranged and connected in the order you chose them.
If the tasks are not in the right order (START - http - lamda - Post_to_Slack) it is possible to rearrange them.
Simply click on the "x" on the connection to remove it and hover over "OUT/IN" where a "+" sign will appear.
Connect all parts this way: START - http - lambda - Post_to_Slack - END. As you can see each task and
workflow has its own set of characters after its name - these are reference
aliases and work as unique identifier.

![FRINX Machine dashboard](tasks.png)

Above every task/workflow you can see 2 squares:

**Edit:**

![FRINX Machine dashboard](update.png)

**Remove/Expand:**

![FRINX Machine dashboard](remove_expand.png)

4) **http - edit**. This task provides multiple methods for working with data from
web pages. In this case we will make a http GET request to fetch data which we
will parse. Click on **edit** above http task. On the right side you can see General
Settings and Input Parameters. Leave **General Setting** the way they are and
click on **Input Parameters**.
Insert: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/${workflow.input.selector}
in the **URI** and leave other columns unchanged. This set of data will get data
from JSON database based on selectors input. Now click on **“Save Changes”**.

![FRINX Machine dashboard](http_task.png)

5) **lambda - edit**. Lambda takes data from previous http task and returns
parsed data (message text) from JSON Click on **Input parameters** and in the
**Lambda value** insert: ${http_<unique_id>.output.body}. In our example the
name is **http_6MZR**. In the **Script expression** copy-paste: return
JSON.parse($.lambdaValue). Click on **“Save Changes”**.

![FRINX Machine dashboard](lambda_task_edit.png)

6) **Post_to_Slack - edit**. Post_to_Slack is a workflow that can be used
standalone or as a part of other workflows. This workflow works as sender of
messages to specific destination in Slack.
Click on **Input parameters** and in the **slack_webhook_id** insert:
T02BFFVUQ/B04MQ2PRWQ1/xw9pWOAm0e4OMPfPxmrI1Jbp.
In the **message_text** insert: ${lambda_<unique_id>.output.result.title}. Click
on **“Save Changes”**.

![FRINX Machine dashboard](post_to_slack_edit.png)

7) In the upper right corner of the workflow builder click on **“Save and execute”**.
Now the workflow is ready to be executed. Insert a number between 1 - 200 in
the **selector** and press **Execute**.

![FRINX Machine dashboard](execute.png)

8) Click on **“Executed workflow in detail”**. Here you can see that workflow was
executed and every task was completed successfully.

![FRINX Machine dashboard](wf_run_detail.png)

The output (demo Latin JSON) of the workflow in the Slack:

![FRINX Machine dashboard](slack_output.png)

You can join the slack channel where the message from this workflow is sent
and check if it was sent successfully:

## Demo: Creating a loopback address on devices stored in the inventory

This workflow creates a loopback interface on all devices installed in the inventory or on all devices filtered by labels. Labels are markers that serve as a differentiator.

1) Check if all devices are installed. You can install them manually or by executing the **Install_all_from_inventory / 1** workflow.

![FRINX Machine dashboard](devices_dashboard.png)

2) On the main page, select **Explore workflows**. In the **Search by keyword** column, enter *loopback*. The **Create_loopback_all_in_uniconfig / 1** workflow will appear in the list. Under **Actions**, select the corresponding **Run** button for the workflow.

![FRINX Machine dashboard](create_loopback_all_in_uniconfig.png)

4) Under **loopback_id**, insert *77* and select **Execute**. Click on the link that appears.

![FRINX Machine dashboard](create_loopback_execute.png)

5) All tasks were executed correctly and are completed.

![FRINX Machine dashboard](details_of_create_loopback.png)

On the results page, you will see five individual tasks:

### INVENTORY_get_all_devices_as_dynamic_fork_tasks
This workflow displays a list of all devices in the inventory or devices filtered by label. It parses the output in the correct format for the dynamic fork, which creates a number of tasks depending on the number of devices in the inventory. 

### SUB_WORKFLOW
This is the dynamic fork sub-workflow. In this case, it creates **UNICONFIG_write_structured_device_data** for every individual device in the inventory. You can then get detailed information on the progress and succession of every device.

### UNICONFIG_calculate_diff
This remote procedure call creates a difference between the actual UniConfig topology devices and the intended UniConfig topology nodes. 

### UNICONFIG_dryrun_commit
This remote procedure call resolves the difference between actual and intended device configurations. After all changes are applied, the cli-dryrun journal is read and a remote procedure call output is created and returned. 

### UNICONFIG_commit
This is the final task that actually commits the intended configuration to the devices.
