FRINX Workflow Manager introduction
==========================

FRINX Workflow Manager allows customers to create automated, repeatable, digital
processes to build, grow and operate their digital communication
infrastructure. FRINX Workflow Manager is based on open-source components and
enables infrastructure and network engineers to create and operate
workflows to implement configuration changes and obtain operational data
from their heterogeneous networks and clouds. Typical examples are the
automation of services that span resources in the cloud and physical
assets, the automation of slices and capacity increases in mobile
networks, the interaction with CRM and inventory systems, the management
of Internet and Infrastructure services and the automation of core
network functions. Workflow Manager can be deployed standalone or as part of
FRINX Machine.

FRINX Workflow Manager uses Netflix's Conductor for task/workflow orchestration.
We recommend to take a look at their
[Documentation](https://conductor.netflix.com/documentation/api/index.html)
as an introduction to Tasks, Workflows, Definitions and an overall
prerequisite to working with FRINX Workflow Manager.
