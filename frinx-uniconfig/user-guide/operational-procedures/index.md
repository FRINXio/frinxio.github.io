# Operational Procedures

## Logging

UniConfig distribution uses Logback as the implementation of the logging
framework. Logback is the successor to to the log4j framework with many
improvements such as more options for configuration, better performance,
and context-based separation of logs. Context-based separation of logs
is used widely in UniConfig to achieve per-device logging based on the
set marker in the logs.

## TLS

TLS is a widely adopted security protocol designed to facilitate
privacy and data security for communications over the Internet. In the
default version of UniConfig TLS authentication is disabled.

## TLS for Postgres database

By default, UniConfig communicates with the database without TLS, therefore all traffic is not encrypted. When the database is deployed separately from UniConfig, it is advised to enable the TLS encryption.

## OpenAPI

UniConfig distributions contain '.yaml' file that generates list of all
usable RPCs and their examples. You can view it locally or on our hosted version that always shows
latest OpenAPI version.

## Data Security Models

UniConfig supports encryption and hashing of values in RESTCONF and
UniConfig shell API and managing of confidential data during transfer
between UniConfig database and network devices.

## UniConfig Clustering

UniConfig stateless architecture allows deployment of the system in cluster in order to assure
horizontal scalability and high availability properties.
